#### `.env` requirements

#### Running the app
* // no longer needed - node server.js -- // this is now running on azure
* node logger.js
* node nonsense.js

now just watch the test.txt file fill up with nonsense logs! including some that are errors! (anything with JSON in it is an error because why not someone has to be the villain)

#### Tests


#### UML
this UML would be identical to the last lab except with 'sockets' instead of net port thangs. so I reused it
